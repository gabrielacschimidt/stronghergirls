                                <p>
                                    I was a very active student/person until I came to college in the US. I stopped playing basketball and running. Part of the reason I stopped was because life was just so busy in college compared to high school and it's also because I had a campus job. In my opinion though, I feel like the main reason was because I didn't have the self discipline to make myself go to the gym when I was supposed to be there. There was no coach to ask me why I didn't show up . There was no one I had to answer to and just like that I stopped my active life. Other than the fact that I started gaining weight, not working out became a huge concern when it became hard for me to even walk up two stories without running out of breath; my heart rate was very low and I just couldn't take it anymore. I wanted to go back to my active lifestyle. I heard about Sal‘s program-StrongHER Girls™  and I wrote to her. I was very honest to her about my fitness journey and I told her all I felt was going to make her coaching for me the best. And she listened and for every program she created for me to follow, she put into consideration all I had told her. And that's why I think she's the greatest coach anyone can ask for. <u>Putting her clients needs first is the best thing you can ask from your trainer and Sal has got this.</u> 
                                    Getting back to the gym is very hard. It's very challenging and most of the times, we give up because we just can't keep up. I remember missing gym for an entire week and I was so embarrassed to tell Sal what had happened because I thought she'd judge me but she did not. She rather encouraged me to keep going and mentioned that the first few days and weeks were going to even break me but that was okay. So yes, with her coaching you'll be motivated to keep doing your best however difficult things get. With Sal you'll not only become fit but you'll have another kind and beautiful soul to call a friend. <b>I'm so glad I joined StrongHER Girls™ and I'm sure everyone who joins her team will become the best versions of themselves. It's just a matter of time</b>.

                                    <span class="info">Sal's classes helped me with learning how to use weights in the gym, which was something that I tended to stay away from because I didn't know how to use them. I became more confident to try new things and wanted to work on my fitness, not for the look, but to make myself feel more healthy. I became more aware about how to properly workout different muscle groups, which was helpful to understand what workouts I needed to do. Having a motivator like Sal was so helpful in keeping me on track and more persistent. I enjoyed learning from her and I'm so grateful for my time with her!</span>

                                    <span class="info">Sal is an amazing coach and I recommend her to everyone who mentions wanting to get in shape. Sal is my first coach and I have been with her for over 2 years through different phases, from trying to get back in shape, to cutting weight, to wanting accountability for my lifting sessions (which were in conjunction with Muay Thai training), to, finally, focusing exclusively on powerlifting and building strength. At each step Sal was supportive, understanding, while still continuing to push me. I loved our coach-athlete dynamic; I felt as if I was ultimately in control of my fitness journey and she was my expert friend providing me with her extensive knowledge while still respecting me as a whole athlete and person. She encouraged me to continue eating the foods I enjoyed and not restrict myself, and if there was a day I overshot my macros and started feeling guilty she remained supportive and helped me feel better. Sal is the best coach I’ve ever worked with.</span>

She knows exactly what to say and when to say things when it comes to motivating you to do better for yourself. Super understanding, and I believe that's what's missing in the industry right now. Not to be confused with not challenging, the stuff she has you do tests you, but it's doable. Definitely a breath of fresh air.</span>

                                    <span class="info">Sal is a fantastic strength and life coach. She doesn’t just look at how much you can lift physically, but how much you can carry mentally and emotionally. In addition to your strength training, Sal is knowledgeable enough to help guide your diet, sleep, and meditation schedules. Her programs and coaching are comprehensive and completely personalized for your personal, physical, and psychological goals. She is extremely accepting and respectful of gender diversity and understands the importance of working around physical limitations or adjusting a program to meet someone’s specific needs or goals. She is also just generally an inspiration to me because I’ve seen firsthand how she pushes through her own struggles everyday. She’s a true badass tbh. If you work with her and stick to the program you’ll be impressed with your progress by just the 2nd week guaranteed.</span>

I caught a glimpse of it today as I was leaving. I recognize I wasn't actually happy when that photo was taken. My brain was healing from a concussion, I was trying to make everyone around me happy, I was struggling with body image issues and too embarrassed to ask anyone for help. 4 years later, my brain is healthy, I'm learning to put myself first, and I'm mending my relationship with my body. College sophomore Em would be proud ❤
                                    All my love to Sal and her business for helping me discover a love of lifting. She's truly doing the good work to empower womxn/femme/trans/gnc folx and if you haven't yet, look into her coaching services. She's the best ❤</span>
